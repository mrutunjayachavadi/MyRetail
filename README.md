Assumptions made for the use cases mentioned below
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Case :: Responds to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers product data as JSON (where {id} will be a number. 

I have assumed the Datastore to be RDBMS(Postgres), on matching the product id, product data is fetched from the postgres.

Use Case :: Performs an HTTP GET to retrieve the product name from an external API. (For this exercise the data will come from redsky.target.com,
 but letâ€™s just pretend this is an internal resource hosted by myRetail)

 For above use case I have hosted the Example url mentioned in the use case in the myretail rest service to fetch the product name from external 
 service endpoint given
 
 Use Case :: Reads pricing information from a NoSQL data store and combines it with the product id and name from the HTTP request into a single response.
 I have used mongodb as NoSQL datastore for above use case, based on the product id price is fetched from 

Considerations for the Production Environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Authentication and Authorization should be added for the restful web service.
2. Data Validation for all the api's should be added.
3. Exception handling  can be improved to include proper response messages for failure/erroneous scenarios.
4. Externalization of property files like application.properties for pointing application to desired datastore.
